            <blockquote>
<p>I was going to publish this when my investigation was complete. I have spent a long time, tonnes of resources and time
to expose this problem and find accountability. I emailed the guardian about this about six months ago and heard nothing
back, assuming it was auto-filed in a 'cooker bullshit' inbox. Well, they published something a few weeks back, taking
all credit and inadvertently stonewalled further investigation by triggering the cops to refer it to IBAC.</p>
<p>Here's the incomplete version that's mostly about activism under capital</p>
<p>That is so much time and money I'm not getting back so, don't trust establishment media even if they're not of the
murdoch variety, apparently</p>
</blockquote>
<p>i run a little web application called <a href="https://vicpolsearches.xyz/">vicpolsearches</a>.</p>
<p>when I had a twitter account many moons ago, one of the accounts i followed was @vicpolsearches - a simple aggregation
of control of weapons search area notices (i think manually scraped).</p>
<h3>control of who what</h3>
<p>okay, so, let me explain - in victoria, we have an act called the control of weapons act 1990. it basically outlines
powers around possessing various weapons in the state, like what counts as a weapon, who's allowed to have a weapon and
where they can be... haved?</p>
<p>as an act of parliament it also outlines the penalties for possessing weapons wrong. it was most recently amended a few
months back as part of the highly publicised machete ban; on the surface, it just made it so you can't own and sell
machetes. if you're hiding danny trejo, you gotta give him up, sorry :(</p>
<p>as a part of this amendment, though, they also massively expanded the police commissioner's powers to declare what they
term a 'Designated Search Area'. these are the areas that are described in the notices @vicpolsearches posted.</p>
<h3>derro lurch areas??</h3>
<p>designated search areas are places where anybody can be stopped and searched by police and moved on without a warrant,
without probable cause, for any reason, at any time. the justification for this is to search for weapons. the rate at
which they actually find a weapon is <a href="https://www.fclc.org.au/expandedpolicepower">1%</a>. rounded up.</p>
<p>so, they're not very good at finding weapons.</p>
<p>the areas <em>do</em> have parameters that must eb met before they can be declared, as described under section
<a href="https://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/vic/consol_act/cowa1990216/s10d.html">10D(1)</a> of the act:</p>
<ul>
<li>more than one incident of "violence or disorder" that involved a weapon has occurred in the area in the last year
and it might happen again</li>
<li>more than one incident of "violence or disorder" that involved a weapon has occurred in the area in the last year
and the police want to use search powers as a deterrant</li>
<li>an event is being held where "violence or disorder" has happened before and it is likely that "the violence or disorder will recur"</li>
<li>an event is being held and the police have bad juju about it</li>
</ul>
<p>now, idk if you've lived in melbourne before, but disorder is basically the background of life. there is no definition
of disorder in the act. disorder could be basically anything. weapons are more clear-cut.
<a href="https://www.armstronglegal.com.au/criminal-law/vic/offences/controlled-weapon-prohibited-weapon/">slightly.</a></p>
<p>combat knives, guns, yeah that's all good. whips? i mean, there is a <em>big</em> bdsm community in melbourne. fake guns
probably puts cosplayers at risk. "Any other article that is carried with the intention of being used as a weapon." is
the vaguest catch-all i've ever seen. burden of proof is doing a lot here - it's impossible to prove that you're not
using your walking stick as a weapon.</p>
<p>due to a massive lack of transparency, it's also impossible to know exactly what weapons were allegedly found to justify
the declaration of a search area.</p>
<p>the recent legislation change made these powers broader and longer-lasting; before september 1 there was a limit of 12
hours that a declaration could last. now they can be declared for up to six months at a time, and in fact the day the
amended legislation came into effect the police commissioner enacted three six-week long search areas declared around
every major transport hub in the melbourne cbd. this is nothing short of dick-swinging display of power (which you'll
be familiar with if you've lived in melbourne long enough, it's something our political and police class will do at
the drop of a hat).</p>
<p>overwhelmingly these designated areas are <a href="https://blog.centreagainstracialprofiling.au/issues/1">enforced racially</a> and
used to <a href="https://mals.au/2023/11/05/designated-areas-as-protest-control/">brutalise protesters</a>.</p>
<p>section 10D and E of the control of weapons acts purpose is not to control weapons -
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_purpose_of_a_system_is_what_it_does">it's to justify oppressive policing</a>.</p>
<h3>okay got it cops bad hurf durf gargle my balls commie</h3>
<p>look i gotta point out now that australians are largely spineless dumb racist bootlickers who cheer on the murder of
homeless black men while complaining about the renters in one of their sixteen investment properties. also im a socialist.</p>
<h3>fine whatver whats the point</h3>
<p>okay there is section 10D(4)(a) of the control of weapons act 1990 a notice of the declared area must be published in the government
gazette and they just have not been very consistent in doin that lately. under section
<a href="https://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/vic/consol_act/cowa1990216/s10d.html">10D(6)</a> the declaration "has
effect, after the date of publication of the notice in the Government Gazette". which means that if the declaration is
<em>not</em> published in the government gazette, it cannot come into effect. but the police have been acting as though they have
come into effect regardless. this is unlawful.</p>
<h3>so?? who cares???</h3>
<p>remember the blog title?</p>
<p>this has been frustrating for me on two fronts:</p>
<ol>
<li>my app scrapes the gazettes, not the victoria police website, so if the declarations aren't published i don't scrape them</li>
<li>the police also have to follow the law. they are not exempt from it just because they're enforcing it.</li>
</ol>
<p>i have started investigating the reason behind the non-publication of these missing notices (did you know its like, $30
to lodge a FOI request now? i pay significant taxes this is fucked) and it will be many, many months before they even
consider actioning it. i have emailed the commissioner and tried to contact other authorities to no avail. there is a
rotten culture of opaqueness and secrecy that permeates all throughout victorias public service and alone we are
powerless to change it. as an outsider i am doing one thing: trying to find out why something didn't happen and publish
the reason; maybe it'll make sure it doesn't happen again. and none of this is my job. somebody is paid probably more
than i am to do this in the corporate structure of victoria police and they... just didn't.</p>
<p>activism isn't primarily people jumping on coal trains or blowing up pipelines - it's just doing another persons job
for them and trying to find accountability.</p>
<p>it turns out! that these structures are designed to stop you doing that and elide accountability. they are designed to
waste your time and hope you just give up. your stamina is a limited resource and they know this, so they will wear you
down until the fatigue sits in and you acquiesce.</p>
